## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 


Welcome to my GitHub profile! 
Looking for <strong>code smells</strong> and <strong>useless junk code</strong> experiments?
Then you are in the right place, my friend! ðŸ¤­

I like to work on silly front-end projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but you may also find some .NET - I use that for more "serious" purposes.
Would love to make some XR stuff in the future - we'll see ðŸ™ƒ
